# Offensive Security: The Best Offense is a Good Defense

## Key Concept: Strategic Offensive Principle of War

- "The best offense is a good defense."
- Sun Tzu: "Attack is the secret of defense; defense is the planning of an attack."
- The idea applies in warfare, chess, intellectual property law, and cybersecurity.
- Offensive security takes a proactive approach to cybersecurity by identifying vulnerabilities before attackers do.

## What is Offensive Security?

- A proactive and adversarial approach to protecting computer systems, networks, and individuals from cyberattacks.
- Involves penetration testing, red teaming, and vulnerability assessments.
- Helps organizations identify and mitigate security weaknesses before they are exploited.
- Offensive security professionals are hired to "punch" organizations (test their defenses) before real attackers do.

## Importance of Offensive Security

- Identifies vulnerabilities before they are exploited.
- Helps organizations make accurate risk assessments.
- Mimics an attacker's mindset to find security weaknesses.
- Prevents potential breaches by enhancing defensive security.

## The Kill Chain Concept

### Origin and Definition

- The term "Kill Chain" originates from military strategy, referring to a structured sequence of attack phases.
- Initially designed to describe the attack process in warfare:
    1. **Identification** – Locating the target.
    2. **Dispatch Forces** – Sending attack units.
    3. **Engage Target** – Launching an attack.
    4. **Destroy Target** – Achieving the objective.
- The concept has been adapted into cybersecurity to analyze and disrupt attack patterns.

### OODA Loop: A Generalized Decision Model

- Another related model used in security and warfare is the **OODA Loop**:
    1. **Observe** – Gather intelligence.
    2. **Orient** – Analyze information and strategize.
    3. **Decide** – Choose an action.
    4. **Act** – Execute the decision.
- This model closely parallels the Kill Chain by structuring how security teams analyze and respond to threats.

### Cyber Kill Chain

- The Cyber Kill Chain adapts military strategy to cybersecurity, breaking down a cyberattack into distinct phases:
    1. **Reconnaissance** – Gathering intelligence on the target (e.g., scanning vulnerabilities, social engineering).
    2. **Weaponization** – Preparing attack tools (e.g., malware, exploits).
    3. **Delivery** – Sending malicious payloads (e.g., phishing, drive-by downloads).
    4. **Exploitation** – Executing the attack to gain initial access.
    5. **Installation** – Establishing a foothold (e.g., backdoors, persistence mechanisms).
    6. **Command and Control (C2)** – Maintaining control over compromised systems.
    7. **Actions on Objectives** – Achieving attack goals (e.g., data exfiltration, system destruction).
- Understanding this chain helps security professionals detect, disrupt, and mitigate attacks.

### Breaking the Chain: Defensive Strategy

- Since a kill chain consists of sequential links, breaking any stage prevents the attack from succeeding.
- Defensive teams focus on:
    - **Early detection** (Reconnaissance phase).
    - **Strong perimeter defenses** (Delivery phase).
    - **Limiting privilege escalation** (Exploitation phase).
    - **Preventing persistence** (Installation phase).
    - **Monitoring for C2 activity** (Command and Control phase).

## The MITRE ATT&CK Framework

### Overview

- **MITRE ATT&CK** (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, & Common Knowledge) is a widely-used framework documenting real-world adversarial behaviors.
- Essential for security professionals in both defensive and offensive security.
- Provides structured knowledge for understanding and mitigating cyber threats.

### ATT&CK Matrices

- Organizes threats into **Tactics & Techniques**.
- Three primary matrices:
    1. **ATT&CK Enterprise** – Focuses on threats targeting enterprise IT networks.
    2. **ATT&CK Mobile** – Covers adversarial behaviors targeting mobile devices.
    3. **ATT&CK ICS** – Focuses on industrial control systems (ICS) threats.
- The Enterprise matrix is the most commonly referenced.

### Tactics and Techniques

- **Tactics** represent **the "why"** of an attack—an adversary’s goals in different attack phases.
    - Examples:
        - **Initial Access** – Gaining entry to the network.
        - **Persistence** – Maintaining access over time.
        - **Privilege Escalation** – Gaining higher-level permissions.
- **Techniques** describe **the "how"**—specific methods adversaries use.
    - Example under **Initial Access**: **Phishing** (sending deceptive emails to trick users).
- Some **Techniques** have **Sub-techniques**, which provide further detail.
    - Example under **Initial Access → Phishing**:
        - **Spearphishing Attachment**
        - **Spearphishing Link**
        - **Spearphishing via Service**
        - **Spearphishing Voice**

### MITRE Groups

- MITRE tracks **Groups**, representing known threat actors and their behaviors.
- Groups are mapped to specific **Tactics & Techniques** in ATT&CK.
- Example: **Andariel (North Korea)**
    - Uses watering hole attacks with **zero-day exploits** to gain initial access.
    - Can be explored in the **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator**.

### Exploring the Matrix

- The **MITRE ATT&CK Navigator** is an interactive tool for exploring **Tactics & Techniques**.
- Allows visualization of how adversaries operate and planning of defensive strategies.
- Security professionals use it to:
    - Identify **threat trends**.
    - Simulate **adversary behavior**.
    - Develop **mitigation strategies**.

### MITRE ATT&CK vs. Cyber Kill Chain

- **CKC (Cyber Kill Chain)** is **linear** and focuses on **early detection and prevention**.
- **MITRE ATT&CK** provides **detailed, flexible, and non-sequential** insights into adversarial behavior.
- **ATT&CK complements CKC** by offering deeper analysis for planning security defenses.

## Key Components of Penetration Testing

### 1. Planning and Reconnaissance

- Gathering intelligence about the target (e.g., public information, scanning for open ports/services, vulnerabilities).
- Understanding the attack surface before launching tests.

### 2. Testing Vulnerabilities

- Evaluating how exploitable vulnerabilities are.
- Prioritizing based on risk (Risk = Likelihood of exploitation × Impact).
- Ensuring organizations focus on fixing critical issues first.

### 3. Analysis and Reporting

- Documenting findings in a structured report.
- Providing actionable recommendations for mitigation.
- Communicating risks effectively to stakeholders (often non-technical executives).
- Not just about technical expertise—clear communication is key!

## Summary

- **Offensive security** is essential for **proactive cybersecurity**.
- **Cyber Kill Chain** provides a structured way to **detect and disrupt attack patterns**.
- **MITRE ATT&CK** offers an **in-depth, flexible framework** for analyzing adversarial tactics.
- Understanding both helps security teams **enhance defenses and anticipate threats**.
- **Security assessments** (pentesting, red teaming) help mitigate vulnerabilities before real attackers exploit them.
- Ethical considerations ensure responsible security testing and legal compliance.
